Question: Write inputs and outputs for the Pythagorean Triplet problem.
-Pythagorean theorem- is the result of a right anged triangle.
a^2 + b^2 = C^2

Try to give yourself a few different cases.
length has to be positive
a negative side will still give correct answer since its squared???

ANSWER
Inputs:

three integers a, b, c representing the sides of a right-angled triangle, where a and b are the shorter sides and c is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)
Outputs:

Boolean value (True or False) indicating whether the input integers form a Pythagorean triplet.
Example:
Inputs: a=3, b=4, c=5
Output: True (3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2)

Inputs:

an integer n representing the upper limit for the search of Pythagorean Triplet
Outputs:

List of Pythagorean triplets found under upper limit n.
Example:
Inputs: n=20
Output: [(3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), (8, 15, 17), (7, 24, 25), (12, 16, 20)
